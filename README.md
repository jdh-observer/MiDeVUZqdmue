Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models challenge researchers in the humanities and invite them to rethink their methods, objects of study, and critical posture (Clavert & Muller, 2024). Historians are increasingly urged to examine the uses and implications of these technologies in the production of knowledge about the past (Meadows & Sternfeld, 2023). Moreover, because of the widespread use of GenAI tools by pupils and students within their educational pathways, this topic takes place into the field of teacher education as well.

These issues incite teacher educators to consider how to foster the development of a critical posture towards GenAI among their students (Clavert & Muller, 2024), and more specifically, among future teachers. In this context, the history of education, as a critical and reflexive discipline, appears as a powerful lever to understand, contextualise, and interrogate the use of GenAI in school and university settings.

Rooted in a socio-historical, pedagogical, and praxeological tradition (Wagnon, 2018), the history of education enables the emergence of a critical professional culture conducive to the analysis of continuities, ruptures, and sedimented effects in teaching practices (Ronveaux & Schneuwly, 2018). It thus offers a means to historicise pedagogical reflection (Novoa, 1997) and serves as a privileged tool for helping future teachers to develop an ethical, reflexive, and context-aware posture (Bandini, 2019).

Our research approach is grounded in the tensions between the way GenAI models operate and the principles of historical critique. While GenAI generates texts based on vast datasets, it does so without clearly referencing sources, without contextualisation, and according to a probabilistic logic that does not adhere to epistemic criteria of truth. These outputs are thus based on reconfigured—and often blurred—data (Sternfeld, 2023; Petit, 2022; Kansteiner, 2022).

In the field of history, this dynamic stands in direct opposition to the principles of historical critique, that are : source gathering and evaluation; document cross-referencing; contextualisation of statements; and bias identification. GenAI produces narratives of the past without historiography, critical framing, or debate —all of which are central to the epistemology of history (Prost, 2010).

Several scholars have stressed the importance of not approaching GenAI as a radical rupture, but rather to situate it within a long genealogy of technical innovations in education (Petit, 2022). From this perspective, the history of education can serve a dual role: on the one hand, it sheds light on the historical dynamics of pedagogical knowledge production and circulation; on the other, it contributes to the development of a critical

posture on GenAI and its uses in educational contexts. The history of educational technologies (Petit, 2022) thus constitutes a valuable training topic to deconstruct the supposed "breakthrough" of GenAI in teaching practices and query an ethical, reflexive, and context-sensitive professional posture.

We intend to test this hypothesis through a Design-Based Research (DBR) approach (Barab & Squire, 2004). This methodology will enable us to articulate and test our design assumptions, as well as to develop and improve our training programme iteratively (Perrin et al., 2025). The study will be conducted during the fall semester of 2025 at the Haute école Pédagogique Vaud (Switzerland), led by an interdisciplinary team working in the fields of the history of education, instructional design, and educational technologies.

We aim to design and trial a training framework that interweaves historical methods (source analysis, contextualisation, critical reading and interpretation) with the use of GenAI tools. This approach seeks to foster constructive doubt (Petit, 2022), enabling future teachers to question GenAI-produced reconstructions of the past, examine their production processes, and identify the biases they entail (Meadows & Sternfeld, 2023). More broadly, it encourages critical reflection on categories embedded in technologies—whether artefactual or symbolic (Perrin & Piot, 2024). In doing so, students will be led to develop a critical posture, not only towards the use of GenAI, but also towards the apparent self-evidence of their own professional gestures, as viewed through the lens of sedimented teaching practices (Ronveaux & Schneuwly, 2018). They will be invited to recontextualise these professional gestures, using a historical approach, in parallel with an analysis of how GenAI models—particularly those based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)—process and present specific historical sources.

We thus argue that the history of education should not be seen merely as a disciplinary content to be transmitted, but as a means of training reflexive teachers capable of interrogating discourse, situating it, and building a professional posture grounded in history, critique, and ethics (Bandini, 2019).
