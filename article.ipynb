    "In this context, the history of education, as a critical and reflective discipline, appears to be a lever for understanding, contextualising and questioning the use of GenAI in schools and universities. Rooted in a tradition that is at once socio-historical, pedagogical and praxeological (<cite id=\"gdx2e\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22732367%2FBWHG9J9J\">(Wagnon, 2018)</a></cite>), the history of education helps to foster a critical professional culture. It thus enables the historicisation of pedagogical reflection (<cite id=\"ss53n\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22732367%2FKK3QZMMW\">(Nóvoa, 1997)</a></cite>) while providing a valuable tool to help future teachers develop an ethical, reflective and contextualised approach (<cite id=\"f6nga\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22732367%2FCFS4GG63\">(Bandini, 2019)</a></cite>). Furthermore, (<cite id=\"5o7z5\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22732367%2FUBWYKEDN\">(Petit, 2022)</a></cite>) emphasised the importance of not approaching GenAI as a radical break in the history of educational technology, but rather as part of a long genealogy of pedagogical transformations. This historical perspective would enable students to adopt a critical stance on the tensions at play between technical and pedagogical innovations (<cite id=\"h9r4f\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22732367%2FQVUZMCWX\">(Tricot, 2017)</a></cite>)."

    "In teacher training, the history of education can play a dual role: on the one hand, it sheds light on the historical dynamics of the production and circulation of pedagogical knowledge; on the other hand, it contributes to the development of a critical stance towards GenAI and its uses in training. To do this, students must be guided in integrating the tools of the historian. First, summarise and articulate the nature of the historical process said as \"source-reading-writing\" (<cite id=\"txx2d\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22732367%2FCYYXJYJE\">(Clavert &#38; Muller, 2024)</a></cite>). Second, collect and evaluate sources, cross-checking documents, contextualise statements, and identify biases. Thirdly, they must analyse sources, place them in their context of production, and proceed to a critical reading and interpretation (<cite id=\"qkzx3\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22732367%2FFKEMVZ89\">(Prost, 2010)</a></cite>). This approach teaches students that truth is the result of a construction of relationships and cannot be reduced to a single proposition (<cite id=\"4dbv4\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22732367%2FCHWBKL7F\">(Munn et al., 2024)</a></cite>). The reconstruction of truth articulates tertiary, secondary and primary retentions that can be questioned (<cite id=\"6ram7\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22732367%2FNWCVZT6F\">(Rouvroy &#38; Stiegler, 2015)</a></cite>). The use of GenAI questions the object of truth (<cite id=\"ryfnw\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22732367%2FANICGCNA\">(Rovira Martorell et al., 2025)</a></cite>), and even the very notion of truth, by distinguishing between a coherentist approach to truth (specific to LLM) and an approach that articulates coherentism and correspondence (specific to humans) (<cite id=\"gec6b\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22732367%2FI8WFU6Y4\">(Compagno, 2025)</a></cite>)."

In other words, we believe that reflection on the \"gestures of the historian\" plays a role in teacher training, but that it also allows us to question the use of GenAI and professional practice. To test our hypothesis, we have focused part of a seminar in our training programme on the history of education approach. To stimulate questions among students and encourage debates that could link the functioning of GenAI, historical approaches and professional practices, we designed activities dedicated to the figure of Henri Roorda\n",

The inability of GenAI to offer \" 'interference' with the text, thus removing 'the human side' \" (Student 2) from the understanding of texts and their perspective, seems to be perceived as problematic by students. This highlights the tension between the coherentist approach to truth (specific to LLM) and an approach that articulates coherentism and correspondence (specific to humans) (<cite id=\"o81ya\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22732367%2FI8WFU6Y4\">(Compagno, 2025)</a></cite>) mentioned in the problem statement."

As exemplified by one student, in the exercise in question, the tensions that run through Henri Roorda's biography do not appear in the biographical reconstructions carried out with GenAI. It is therefore necessary, according to the students, to adopt a critical eye, because \"if we don't read between the lines of what it offers, we don't realise everything that was at stake behind it\" (Student 2)."

And here we have concrete proof of what we have experienced\", Student 2).

It prompted them to use inductive categories of analysis to examine the GenAI output (Perrin and Piot, 2024), a dynamic that we mentioned in our third hypothesis.

These post-sequence reflections were discussed with the project group, which plans to set up a second sequence with the aim of creating a new opportunity for reflection on the issues surrounding the use of GenAI."

    "As a reminder, the second sequence (10.10.2025), like the first, aims to confront students with constructive doubt. To do this, we invited the seminar group to use GenAI to trace the origins of a series of active teaching methods, such as field trips, free writing, workshops and work plans. In order to encourage a critical approach to the outputs of GenAI, while providing a clear framework for the activity, we gave the students the following instructions for creating descriptive sheets for these tools: \"Use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to help you describe, document and analyse this tool, while taking a critical look at the information produced\" while clarifying the objectives (\"the aim of this activity is to understand the tool and assess the relevance of the contributions made by the GenAI used\"). We then invited the students to compare the GenAI outputs with scientific studies on the concerned pedagogical tools under investigation. As in the first sequence, to measure the impact of this activity on their critical thinking and reflexivity, we scheduled a discussion session, which was recorded and transcribed. Here too, personal notes taken by one of the trainers involved in the sequence supplemented this data."

So that's a bit... In fact, it's very enumerative and very point by point\", Student 2). This time, these elements are addressed by the students in an even more incisive manner, leading them to debate the issue more deeply, as shown by this statement: \"So really, the fact that it doesn't have access to scientific data like we do, when we look for articles, when we compare the two, we realise that the answers are quite limited and, as she [Student 3] said, they're very general, they don't really go into the depth of the information. So, to get a general idea, I think it's good, it's quick, we don't need to open lots of websites, it gives us a bit of an overview. But if we look for more detail, I think that even when we ask specific questions, we never really get very comprehensive, very detailed answers\" (Student 5)."

But by comparing the information, we can still figure out what it's telling us that is correct. And what should we explore further by doing a little more scientific research? I think a mix of the two is good\" (Student 5). The analysis of the verbatim transcripts therefore shows the adoption of a critical stance towards the outputs of GenAI.

It emphasises points of consensus (cooperation, autonomy, differentiation) but smooths over historical conflicts or controversies. It produces a linear and simplified narrative, whereas scientific texts show a history of tensions, reinterpretations and institutional contexts.

On the other hand, comparing sources is rarely mentioned (10%). These choices are also confirmed when students are asked to think of a moment during the seminar when the use of a GenAI supported their thinking and, conversely, a moment when the GenAI hindered it. The responses provided show that three out of eight respondents mention the adoption of an approach requiring the comparison of several sources as necessary to counter the limitations of AI-generated content.

    "Secondly, the fact that the sequence dedicated to the figure of Henri Roorda was used by students as a meaningful activity for reflecting on GenAI allowed us to emphasise that the history of education does not only play an illustrative (or even anecdotal) role, but that it is a catalyst for debate and controversy. In this regard, as the students' feedback shows, Henri Roorda's biography, marked by ideological and pedagogical tensions, among other things, lends itself well to highlighting what the reconstructions produced by the GenAI tend to smooth over (such as biographical tensions). The comparison between the narratives produced by GenAI and those reconstructed using a historical approach led students to question what had been simplified or even forgotten. Ultimately, focusing the first sequence on a historical figure such as Henri Roorda served as a catalyst: it helped to crystallise the emerging tensions between automated productions and historical reconstructions. This first sequence therefore had the merit of bringing into dialogue the epistemic issues related to reconstructions of the past and the professional and training issues related to the use of GenAI. Thus, the history of education is not only a subject to be taught, but also a lever for training reflective teachers who can question discourses, situating them and constructing a professional stance rooted in history, criticism and ethics (<cite id=\"boftp\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22732367%2FCFS4GG63\">(Bandini, 2019)</a></cite>)."

After our sequences, we noticed that students continued to work with GenAI, but while trying to take a more critical and reflective approach."

The first distinguishes between criticism and limitation of a generated text. Criticism consists of identifying problematic generated texts, while limitation involves understanding why they are problematic. The identification of a limitation stems from a comparison between the text generated by AI and the text written by a historian on the same subject. We therefore emphasise that the comparison focuses on the product and not on the process of the historian's approach. However, we must qualify our interpretation.

Firstly, our research is exploratory and takes place within a specific institutional framework, namely, an elective seminar with a limited number of students. Our results cannot therefore be generalised and must be interpreted within the context described above. Secondly, the trainer observed varying levels of student participation during discussions. The development of a critical stance may therefore not have affected the whole group, or at least not in a uniform and consistent manner. Thirdly, participant observation could also be seen as a limitation, because although we took every possible precaution, this approach may introduce interpretative bias. Finally, our study aimed to measure (or at least attempt to measure) the adoption of a critical stance over the course of a single semester. It therefore does not allow us to assess the potential impact of our teaching sequences on students over time and in other contexts, particularly professional ones."

We have done so while exploring trails for thinking about the training of future teachers in GenAI in a context marked by a reconfiguration of access to knowledge. Secondly, to bring understanding trails to our problem, we have adopted a mixed methodological approach that requires us to step outside our respective fields of expertise and exchange perspectives. This brings us to our third and final strength: the interdisciplinary nature of our team, which brings together specialists in the history of education, philosophy, technology and engineering sciences, and in teacher training. This collaborative work forced us to clarify our respective approaches and to engage in dialogue about our usual approaches and analytical frameworks to co-construct a common language for addressing our research subject, which is also at the intersection of several disciplines. This process of clarification and constant confrontation was a powerful driver of scientific creativity, while opening original action trails to grasp the challenges of GenAI, the historical approach and professional practice."

Throughout his life, he questioned the place of pupils in the school system and practices that encouraged their activity."

    "Influenced from an early age by his father's friends (including Pierre Kopotkine, Elisée Reclus and Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhius), Henri Roorda built his educational philosophy on libertarian and anarchist principles <cite id=\"ny7rh\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22732367%2FU3KEUQIF\">(Ausoni, 2021)</a></cite>. He wrote several books, two of which were bestsellers: Le Pédagogue n'aime pas les enfants (The Teacher Does Not Like Children, 1917) and Avant la grande Réforme de l'an 2000 (Before the Great Reform of 2000, 1925). The first established his reputation and led readers to question and criticise the learning conditions of pupils at the time. The second seems to be more forward-looking, proposing actions and reflective approaches for teaching professionals. Far from seeking to produce scholarly texts or propose a single method, he based his reflections on observations drawn from his own professional experiences as a teacher in a girls' secondary school (1892), then at the Cantonal College and Classical Gymnasium in Lausanne (1905)."

    "Henri Roorda often compares children to defendants; \"and because teachers adopt the tone and methods of judges from day one, pupils naturally take on the attitude of defendants\" (<cite id=\"s6d07\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22732367%2FA4HSD3EL\">(Roorda, 1926)</a></cite>), which, paradoxically, is never a central concern for schoolteachers. Teachers certainly have limited scope for action, imposed by the legislator, but they nevertheless have some room for manoeuvre (promoting the interests of pupils and learning from their mistakes, integrating \"useful knowledge\", intellectual integrity, etc.), and it is precisely this scope for action that Roorda draws our attention to: he does not seek to reform the school, but to teach in a different way. This translates into a desire to make children happier by motivating and surprising them, which would make them more interested and, as a result, more involved in their learning, which can only improve."

    "His commitment to change did not stop there. Roorda also helped to write the Declaration of Principles of the Ferrer School in Lausanne. However, no doubt for fear of losing his job, he refrained from becoming more involved. This tension between the need to be active in a system he denounced was summed up in this letter to his friend Amédée Dubois: \"Two hours in the office does not prevent one from being free in one's thoughts and actions. Unless one is rich, one must think twice before giving up one's salary. Being forced to earn a living the hard way is what takes away all freedom\" (letter to Amédée Dunois, quoted by Ausoni and Delacrétaz, 2025, p.57)."

    "The fear of losing his livelihood undoubtedly contributed to his use of the pseudonym Balthazar when writing some 700 columns in various regional newspapers, some of which were very radical. This persona allowed him to express his verve, his humorous creativity and his thoughts more freely. Balthazar became such an important part of his life that he signed his last work, \"Mon suicide\" [1925] under both names (<cite id=\"96gtn\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C22732367%2F24TYPZXS\">(Ausoni &#38; Delacrétaz, 2025)</a></cite>).

    "His writings do not seem so far removed from our current concerns as teachers and educators. If we consider our questions about the presence and use of technology in education and the colossal amounts of knowledge available via the internet or GenAI, they seem to echo the \"Encyclopaedic Offices where the curious would find all the information they desire\" (Roorda, 1917, p.28) that Roorda described more than 100 years ago. As Alain Ausoni mentions at the end of his 2021 article, we will never stop Roordaring."

Ainsi détournée, elle révèle les trois penchants de ce professeur lausannois pince-sans-rire et discrètement subversif, proche d’Élisée Reclus : l’anarchisme, l’écriture, l’humour. Fort du succès de ses pamphlets pédagogiques, il a livré, parfois sous le pseudonyme de Balthasar, des essais, plus d’un demi-millier de chroniques, une série d’almanachs drolatiques, des levers de rideau… Son oeuvre questionne non sans bienveillance l’esprit et les moeurs de la société romande du début du 20e siècle. Cent ans après Le pédagogue n’aime pas les enfants ou Mon suicide, quels meilleurs remontants que son combat contre les « bourreurs de crânes », son pacifisme inébranlable et son pessimisme joyeux pour affronter les défis de notre temps ?

Depuis les peintures rupestres préhistoriques jusqu'aux industries numériques contemporaines, en passant par le cinéma ou encore la télévision, il interroge la manière dont l'évolution des supports artificiels transforment nos consciences, nos mémoires, nos imaginations et nos sociétés. Bien que d'une grande actualité, la pensée de ce philosophe majeur du XXIe siècle demeure souvent hermétique, en raison de sa profondeur et de sa complexité. Ce livre a pour but de la rendre accessible en la resituant dans ses contextes historique et théorique et en montrant sa pertinence dans l'époque contemporaine. Il fournit ainsi aux lecteurs des points de repères pour circuler dans l'œuvre de Stiegler tout en explicitant les nouveaux chemins théoriques et pratiques que cette œuvre permet d'ouvrir, pour affronter l'urgence des enjeux actuels, en particulier ceux du transhumanisme, de l'intelligence artificielle et de l'Anthropocène. https://www.puf.com/penser-avec-bernard-stiegler.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence is making history, literally. Machine learning tools are playing a key role in crafting images and stories about the past in popular culture. AI has probably also already invaded the history classroom. Large language models such as GPT-3 are able to generate compelling, non-plagiarized texts in response to simple natural language inputs, thus providing students with an opportunity to produce high-quality written assignments with minimum effort. In a similar vein, tools like GPT-3 are likely to revolutionize historical studies, enabling historians and other professionals who deal in texts to rely on AI-generated intermediate work products, such as accurate translations, summaries, and chronologies. But present-day large language models fail at key tasks that historians hold in high regard. They are structurally incapable of telling the truth and tracking pieces of information through layers of texts. What's more, they lack ethical self-reflexivity. Therefore, for the time being, the writing of academic history will require human agency. But for historical theorists, large language models might offer an opportunity to test basic hypotheses about the nature of historical writing. Historical theorists can, for instance, have customized large language models write a series of descriptive, narrative, and assertive histories about the same events, thereby enabling them to explore the precise relation between description, narration, and argumentation in historical writing. In short, with specifically designed large language models, historical theorists can run the kinds of large-scale writing experiments that they could never put into practice with real historians.",

      "abstract": "As AI technologies are rolled out into healthcare, academia, human resources, law, and a multitude of other domains, they become de-facto arbiters of truth. But truth is highly contested, with many different definitions and approaches. This article discusses the struggle for truth in AI systems and the general responses to date. It then investigates the production of truth in InstructGPT, a large language model, highlighting how data harvesting, model architectures, and social feedback mechanisms weave together disparate understandings of veracity. It conceptualizes this performance as an operationalization of truth, where distinct, often-conflicting claims are smoothly synthesized and confidently presented into truth-statements. We argue that these same logics and inconsistencies play out in Instruct’s successor, ChatGPT, reiterating truth as a non-trivial problem. We suggest that enriching sociality and thickening “reality” are two promising vectors for enhancing the truth-evaluating capacities of future language models. We conclude, however, by stepping back to consider AI truth-telling as a social practice: what kind of “truth” do we as listeners desire?",

      "abstract": "Cet article s’intéresse à l’impact de formes d’intelligence artificielle (IA) sur trois aspects de la pratique de l’histoire : découverte et lecture de sources primaires, interprétation puis écriture et diffusion de la recherche. Des corpus de sources sont collectés, rassemblés et traités avec des algorithmes liés à l’apprentissage machine (machine learning) ; la production de sources est modifiée par le développement des grands modèles de langage (LLM) donnant à voir des documents plausibles plutôt que véridiques ou authentiques, invitant à réfléchir au futur de la critique historienne. Du côté de la lecture, l’IA est déjà mobilisée dans la mise en relation de documents, ce qui permet de poser de nouvelles questions à des corpus très volumineux. Enfin, l’écriture de l’histoire commence à être affectée par l’IA : les principaux logiciels de bureautique proposent déjà des aides à la rédaction adossés aux LLM (dont ChatGPT). Ces évolutions obligent ainsi à reconsidérer l’auctorialité historienne.",

      "abstract": "La mise à la disposition du grand public des IA génératives constitue un défi pour l’enseignement supérieur. Pour faire face à cette situation, nous proposons de concevoir des tâches permettant aux étudiants et étudiantes d’évaluer la pertinence des textes générés par les IA. Nous le faisons en nous engageant dans un processus itératif de conception qui s’inscrit dans une méthode de recherche basée sur la conception. Ce processus nous permet d’expliciter et de tester nos hypothèses de conception. Celles-ci portent notamment sur les conditions de viabilité des configurations d’activités collectives en formation et sur l’incidence de toute technique – et ici de la technique des IA génératives – sur la cognition humaine.",
